What is SWEET32 Birthday Attack?
Your web server encrypts data using cryptographic keys. These keys are chosen randomly, and the probability of any two customers getting the same key is very low.
With the SWEET32 vulnerability, it is now shown that an attacker can send in large volume of dummy data, and get blocks of cipher text that matches that of a customer.
It is possible because the 64-bit blocks used by 3DES-DES generates a lot of packets, which increases the probability of an encrypted packet of a customer and that of the attacker matching. To break it down:
- The attacker sniffs all data sent to your customer.
- Attacker sends dummy data to your server until a key used for a customer matches the attacker’s session key.
- Once there’s a match, sensitive data can be decrypted by determining how the key was chosen.
